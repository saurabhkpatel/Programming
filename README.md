This repository includes programming assignments and sample coding program.

1) Python :

I took python coursera class and completed its assignments. Please check assignments folder for that. All of these program development has been done in web browser using CodeSkulptor. If you happen to be a dedicated Internet Explorer user, please take a few moments to download the latest version of either Chrome, Firefox or Safari (Mac only) since CodeSkulptor does not support Internet Explorer at this point. 


2) Data Structures :

Developed optimized and efficient priority queue using heap and hash table implementation.
